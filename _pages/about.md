I am a Ph.D. student at the Indian Institute of Technology Patna, India, and a researcher in Natural Language Processing, under the supervision of Dr. Asif Ekbal. My research is focused on: (i). Advancing sentiment research in coarse-grained and fine-grained levels including low-resource domains and languages, (ii). Exposing the vulnerabilities of text classifiers builds on the top of pre-trained language models through adversarial attacks and further improving the robustness against these attacks, (iii). Emotion Detection.
 
I have also worked on multimodal opinion mining and robustness of dialogue generation systems against adversarial attacks. Both the works are under-review. Currently, I am exploring the fairness of socially intelligent systems.
