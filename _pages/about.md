I am working as a postdoctoral research associate in the Department of Informatics at King's College London. I am working with Dr Oana Cocarascu on the robustness of fact verification systems. Prior to this, I obtained my Ph.D. in the AI-NLP-ML Lab at the Indian Institute of Technology Patna. My thesis title was “Advancing Sentiment Analysis: From Diverse Domains to Multilinguality and Robustness.”

My research is focused on: (i). Robustness of uni-modal and multi-modal ML systems, (ii). Fact Verification (iii). Opinion Mining, (iv). Multilinguality, (v). Fairness in ML
