I am working as a postdoctoral research associate in the Department of Informatics at King's College London. I am working with Dr Oana Cocarascu on the robustness of fact verification systems. Prior to this, I obtained my Ph.D. in the AI-NLP-ML Lab at the Indian Institute of Technology Patna. My thesis title was “Advancing Sentiment Analysis: From Diverse Domains to Multilinguality and Robustness.”

My research is focused on: (i). Advancing sentiment research in coarse-grained and fine-grained levels including low-resource domains and languages, (ii). Exposing the vulnerabilities of text classifiers builds on the top of pre-trained language models through adversarial attacks and further improving the robustness against these attacks, (iii). Emotion Detection.
